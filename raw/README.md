### Folder for raw sequences data

Add a raw sequence file in FASTA format to this folder. When provided without separate metadata file, the headers should follow the header formatting with collection date at the end of the header after a vertical line "|". Add the name of the raw FASTA file to  [`config.yaml`](../config.yaml) without format extension.
